Running and computers have been my passions since childhood. As an elementary school student, I ran my first 10K race, and I remember how proud I was of myself. Was it proving something, or conquering myself? At that age, probably both.

Years later, the path led me back to my childhood. Almost simultaneously, I joined a local running club and started learning programming independently.

## The First Steps

The first kilometers and first lines of code weren't easy at all, but I didn't give up. On the table were two decisions: **run my first half marathon and become a programmer.**

Which is harder of the two, you might ask? Believe me, it's much easier to run – although many of you might not think so. But both goals require consistency and mental strength.

## The First Victories

**In 2022, I ran my first half marathon in 1:40.**

The time isn't important – what matters is that feeling of pride and satisfaction, the euphoria that the race brings, along with the encouragement from clubmates. At the end of that journey, you know you've done something great.

**A year later, I built my first website for a client.**

The feeling that you've created something that has a purpose, something someone is willing to pay for, is indescribable. Just as time doesn't matter in running, money doesn't matter here either – **what matters is that my knowledge is valued.**

## The Parallel Journey

Today, these two things are an inseparable part of my life. Clients and races follow one after another. Times improve, websites become more complex, but **this mix of physical and mental pushes me forward.**

## The Wake-Up Call

I had a period of 6 months when I didn't run. I tried to throw all my cards into growing as fast as possible in programming.

Do you know what the result was? **Hypertension.**

And the doctor's advice? _"Start moving. Your heart is fine, but your lifestyle isn't."_

I didn't need to be told twice. After two months of running, my health was excellent again.

## Why Running Matters for Developers

Now I dream of a marathon – is there a more beautiful dream than that?

Running isn't just an excellent tool to absorb accumulated stress or counteract excessive sitting. **It's very often my source of solutions to programming problems.**

Sometimes, if we step away from the computer – even though we've been searching for a solution for hours – and forget about the problem for a moment, the solution just appears out of nowhere.

Well, it's not exactly "out of nowhere." Sometimes we're simply too tired to see it. And sometimes, just like in running, **in programming too: less is more.**

## The Lesson

**You can't code 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and expect to stay healthy and productive.**

Your body needs movement. Your mind needs breaks. Your career needs balance.

Running taught me that **consistency beats intensity**. Marathon training isn't about one brutal workout – it's about showing up, week after week, building gradually.

Programming is the same. You don't become a developer in one all-nighter. You become one through **persistent, sustainable effort.**

## Final Thoughts

If you're a developer who doesn't move: **start today.**

Not because you need to run a marathon. Not because you need abs.

**Because your career depends on your health.** And your health depends on movement.

Find your thing – running, gym, swimming, cycling. Doesn't matter.

What matters is that you **move your body so your mind can grow.**
