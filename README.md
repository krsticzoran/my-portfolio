## About

Hi! I'm **Zoran Krstić**, a front-end developer passionate about building clean, performant, and user-friendly web applications.  
This portfolio showcases my work, skills, and the technologies I use.

- 📬 **Contact Form** – Easy way to get in touch directly from the site.

## Security and Anti-Spam Measures

To protect the contact form from spam and abuse, several techniques have been implemented:

- 🕳️ **Honeypot Field** – A hidden input that only bots tend to fill. If it's filled, the submission is flagged as spam.
- ⏱️ **Time-Based Check** – If the form is submitted in under 3 seconds, it's likely a bot and gets rejected.
- 🧼 **Input Sanitization** – All form inputs are sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and malicious code injection.
- 🚫 **Rate Limiting** – Per-IP request limiting is implemented using an in-memory lru-cache. Requests are throttled to prevent spam and brute-force attacks.

## Status

🚧 This project is in its final development phase.

The website is already visually polished and fully representative, but a few tasks remain:

- Final testing and refinements
- Minor visual and UX improvements
