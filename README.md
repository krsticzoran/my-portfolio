## Security and Anti-Spam Measures

To protect the contact form from spam and abuse, several techniques have been implemented:

- 🕳️ **Honeypot Field** – A hidden input that only bots tend to fill. If it's filled, the submission is flagged as spam.
- ⏱️ **Time-Based Check** – If the form is submitted in under 3 seconds, it's likely a bot and gets rejected.
- 🧼 **Input Sanitization** – All form inputs are sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and malicious code injection.
- 🚫 **Rate Limiting** – (Planned) Implementation of per-IP request limiting to prevent brute-force and spam attempts.

## Status

🚧 This project is in its final development phase.

The website is already visually polished and fully representative, but a few tasks remain:

- Implementing rate limiting on the contact form
- Final testing and refinements
- Minor visual and UX improvements
